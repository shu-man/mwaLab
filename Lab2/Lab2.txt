Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
->We want setImmediate instead of setTimeout because it is faster.setImmediate doesn't use queue of functions like setTimeout instead
it checks queue of I/O eventhandlers and after all the I/O events are processed it executes the callback.After the last I/O handler
it queues them immediately whereas setTimeout will be slow because it checks the timer at least once before executing and if function
is called it is not executed immediately it is pushed in the queue and executed after all the current queued eventhandlers gets executed
first.

Difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate()
->process.nextTick() adds the callbacks into the nextTick queue which is not part of the event loop.Node processes all the callbacks
in the nextTick queue after the current operation completes and before the event loop starts.
In case of setImmediate it queues all the I/O events in the queue and it is a part of the event loop.After all the I/O events in the
current snapshot are processed,it executes the callback.
